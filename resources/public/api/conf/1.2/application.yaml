  title: Tax-free childcare payment integration API
  description: "# Overview
  
  It is a government initiative to encourage more parents to use the tax-free childcare (TFC) allowance available to them. To promote this service we want to make it easier for parents to make payments using the funds in their tax-free childcare account.   


This API allows online cashless payment providers for schools to offer their users the opportunity to use their TFC balance to pay for their childcare through the providers platform.


    There are three different operations involved in this process:\n\
    - Linking the parent's TFC account with their account on the online payment provider platform.
    
    - Checking the balance on the child's TFC account.
    
    - Making a payment from the child's TFC account to the childcare provider.
    
    Requests are passed to National Savings and Investments (NS&I), who hold the TFC account funds."

      summary: Linking the parent's online payment provider account to their TFC account
      description: 
        "This endpoint links the parent's TFC account with an account they hold with an online payment provider. This linking will be initiated by the payment provider's platform when offering TFC to the parent as an option to pay for their child's care. The parent will be required to confirm if they want this link to be created. This link is essential if the parent wishes to use TFC within the payment provider's platform."
