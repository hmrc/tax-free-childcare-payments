There is a government initiative to encourage parents to use the Tax-Free Childcare (TFC) allowance available to them. This API allows online cashless payment providers to offer parents the opportunity to pay for their childcare with their TFC balance through the provider's platform.
There are 3 different operations involved in this process:
- Linking the parent's TFC account with their account on the online payment provider's platform
- Checking the balance of the child's TFC account
- Making a payment from the child's TFC account to the childcare provider

### Prerequisites

For the technical details on how to start using our APIs, please read the [Using the Developer Hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/using-the-hub) page. 

### Post-Development

Once you’ve completed your development, we’ll issue you 3 documents along with the Terms of Use to fill out and sign. These will be a Data Sharing agreement, a Supplier Assurance Questionnaire and Evidence of Testing Checklist. These documents will have to be filled out and signed before being onboarded.

- ***Data Sharing Agreement*** - allows information to be shared between the parties involved.
- ***Supplier Assurance Questionnaire*** - gives us evidence that you have the correct processes and controls in place to hold the data we share with you securely.
- ***Evidence of Testing Checklist*** - ensures you have everything in place within your development ready to go live.
